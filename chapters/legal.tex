It is clear that Legacy may involve several legal implications that go beyond the team expertise---at least in its current form. Some legal issues identified so far include:

\section{The Legacy Foundation} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_legacy_foundation}

Even when all technical aspects are working perfectly, finding people to deliver memories entrusted to Legacy may be difficult. Recipients may move, change their phone numbers, their email addresses, etc. To handle those edge cases, a separate foundation will be created. The foundation will take care of correctly transmitting user’s assets if and only if purely automated means fail. 
The second mission of the foundation will be to advocate for change in the legislative process of transmitting properties.
In addition, the foundation will run at least one Ethereum / Swarm node.

In order to ensure correct operation, the Legacy Foundation will receive a percentage of the service operation fees, which will be automatically transferred from user’s smart contracts once the service is paid.
